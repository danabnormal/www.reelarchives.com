## Who are you?
Hi. I'm Dan. I collect media and archive their contents. Its a laugh! Here is the web home of Reel Archives, initially a YouTube channel for the sharing of reel to reel tape contents, we're growing and needed a more text-based interface to allow us to serve more types of content.

Initially this space is being used for the storage of recovered Teletext pages however we'll be posting a lot more new stuff soon, including companion articles for our YouTube content as well as 'behind the scenes' stuff detailing faults and fixes for the kit we use in the hope it helps others.

Thanks for stopping by!
